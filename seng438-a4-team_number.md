# Introduction

The objective of this lab is to explore mutation testing and web user interface (UI) testing in a controlled environment. To perform mutation testing, we used PITest, which automates the process and generates several mutations, which are in turn reported as either surviving or killed. After analyzing the results, we created additional test cases to kill mutants which were previously surviving, thereby improving the mutation score. Web UI testing was carried out using Selenium IDE, which is a browser extension that can record and replay actions on a webpage. Selenium was used to test and confirm that the webpage functionalities were working as intended.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
